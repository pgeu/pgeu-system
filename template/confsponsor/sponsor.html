Voucher codes are used to pay for an entire registration, and can

it will cover the registration, but any additional items purchased
will be paid for by the attendee. A single voucher can only be used
by one attendee.

Discount codes are codes that will give either a fixed amount of

used by multiple attendees, but have a limit on the number of
uses.

You can purchase discount codes to for example give to employees
or customers. The cost of the discounts used will automatically
be invoiced to you once the code is used.
