# Step by step to create a new conference

The following is not an exhaustive list, but hopefully enough to get
off the ground.

1. Create a new [conference](super_conference.md) (must be done by a
   superuser).
1. Configure all the metadata on the [conference](configuring.md).
1. Set up call for papers
    1. Add one or more [tracks](schedule.md#tracks), and decide if they
       should be included in the call for papers.
    1. Call for papers can now be opened

       can be connected to the registration types.
    1. Add one or more
       [registration classes](registrations.md#typesandclasses).
	1. Add one or more
       [registration types](registrations.md#typesandclasses).
    1. If used, add one or more
       [additional options](registrations.md#additionaloptions).
    1. Decide if [tickets](tickets.md) and check-in should be used, and
       in this case create a template for tickets if a special design
       is needed.
    1. Registration can now be opened
1. Set up schedule
    1. Wait for the call for papers to finish.
