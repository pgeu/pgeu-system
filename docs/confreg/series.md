# Conference series

A conference series represents a set of "the same" conference that
runs across multiple instances. For example, "PGConf.EU" is a series
and "PGConf.EU 2018" is an instance.

Conference series are primarily used for permissions, the
[e-mail opt-out](emails#optout) functionality and for providing
introductory information on the main website.


## Permissions

If a user is made administrator of a conference series, they
automatically gain administrative permissions on all conferences in
the series. They also get access to cross-conference reports and
emails.
