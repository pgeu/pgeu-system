# Volunteer schedule

The volunteer schedule system ties together attendees with
[volunteer slots](#slots).

To begin, create the slots as needed in the administrative interface,
and assign the volunteers using the
[conference configuration](configuring.md). Volunteers can also be added
later on, in which case they will just have to sign up for what's
left.

Once all slots are available, ask the volunteers to sign up. Anybody
added as a volunteer in the conference configuration will get a link
to the volunteer schedule on their registration page (once
registration is completed).

### Normal workflow

Normally, each volunteer signs up for the slot(s) they are interested
in working on. Once this is done, the administrator can either *confirm*
or *delete* the volunteer for this specific slot.

### Admin-driven workflow

The other way to add volunteers is to have the administrator add them
from the admin interface. In this case the assignment *also* becomes
unconfirmed, and now requires the volunteer to confirm it from *their*
registration page.
