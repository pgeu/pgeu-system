<p>
Your {{sponsor.level}} sponsorship for {{conference}}
has now been fully confirmed. Thank you for your support!
</p>

<p>
You can reach the full details about your sponsorship and it's
benefits by going to your sponsorship dashboard page at any time.
</p>

{{ button("View sponsorship dashboard", sponsorbase) }}

<p>
For some of the benefits that come with your sponsorship we ask that
you either provide more data, or just indicate that you wish to take
part of the benefit. In the cases that there is a benefit that you do
not wish to use, please indicate that as well by explicitly declining
the benefit on the dashboard - this will make our planning of resources
before and during the conference much easier!
</p>

<p>
At any time when you return to the dashboard page, you will be able to
view an archive of all informational emails sent out to sponsors. This
includes both the emails sent after you signed up (which will also be
delivered to your email address of course) and an archive of all previously
sent emails. We suggest you take a moment to review any previous emails
found in that archive, to make sure you are not missing any important
information.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if there are multiple people from your organization who are
involved with the sponsorship, you may add them as co-managers on the
dashboard page. Anybody added as a manager will both be able to claim
and decline benefits, and all outgoing emails will be sent with one copy
to each manager.
</p>

<p>
Once again, thank you for your support!
