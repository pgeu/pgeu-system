<p>
You are currently on the waitlist for the conference
{{conference.conferencename}}.
</p>
<p>
We have some good news for you! We've been able to open up a seat
at the conference, and made it available for you. If you are still
interested in attending, please complete your registration as soon as possible.
</p>

{{ button("Register now", confbase + "/register/") }}

<p>
Please note that this is a time limited offer. You must complete
your registration, including payment before <strong>{{offerexpires|datetimeformat("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")}}</strong>&,
or it will expire and you will be returned to the waitlist.
</p>

<p>
We realize that this may be short on time, but unfortunately we
have to limit it in order to process the waitlist quickly. Should
you miss this deadline, you will be given a new chance later assuming
we still have open seats!
</p>

<p>
We also ask that if you do NOT want to make a registration based on
this offer, please  cancel your waitlist
registration. This will make it possible for us to process other
entries on the waitlist quicker!
</p>

{{ button("Cancel waitlist", confbase + "/register/") }}

<p>
We hope to see you at {{conference.conferencename}}!
