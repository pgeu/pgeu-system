<p>
You were recently sent an offer from the waitlist for
{{conference.conferencename}}.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately this offer expired on {{offerexpires|datetimeformat("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")}}
without being claimed, and has therefor been canceled.
</p>
<p>
Your registration has been returned to the waitlist at this
point, and if another seat shows up you will be given another
chance.
</p>

<p>
If you are no longer interested in attending the conference, please
remove yourself from the waitlist. That will make our processing
of waitlist entries for other attendees much smoother, and you will
no longer receive emails about it from us.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to remain on the waitlist, you do not need to do
anything. If another seat shows up, an new email outlining this
offer and expiry time will be sent to you.
