You recently made a registration for {{conference.conferencename}},
but it was never completed.
</p>

<p>
As some options for this event are getting close to being sold out,
they have been removed from your pending registration in order to
make room for others. The following option{%if optionscount != 1%}s have{%else%} has{%endif%} been removed:
</p>

<ul>
{%for o in options%}
 <li>{{o.name}}</li>
{%endfor%}
</ul>

<p>
If you are still interested in ordering this option, you may return
to the registration page and add this option back to your registration,
provided it has not yet sold out.
</p>

<p>
If you do that, make sure you complete the registration including payment,
as no seats are guaranteed until the process is completed.
