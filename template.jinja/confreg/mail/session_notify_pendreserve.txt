Hello!

This email is sent to you because the status of your session

{{session.title|safe}}

submitted to {{conference}} has been updated.

We would like to put this session on the reserve list.

Reserve list means that we'd like the ability to approve this session
any time between now and the event, in case another session has
to be canceled. This can include both early cancellations and late
ones due to for example another speaker unable to make it to the event.

For this reason it is important that you are planning to attend the
event regardless of having this session selected, and also that you have
the session prepared and ready to give on short notice.

Before your session is fully moved to the reserve list, we need you to
confirm that you are OK with this. Please go to the website (as linked
below) and confirm your acceptance as soon as you can. If you have any
further questions about what this means, please make sure you contact
us *before* you confirm the reserve listing. You can do so by replying
to this email.

Also, if you do not wish for your session to be used for the reserve
list, please let us know by responding to this email.
