Your offer on the waitlist for {{conference.conferencename}}
has been canceled by an administrator.
</p>
<p>
Your registration has been returned to the regular waitlist, and may
receive further offers in the future.
</p>

<p>
If you are no longer interested in attending the conference, please
remove yourself from the waitlist. That will make our processing
of waitlist entries for other attendees much smoother, and you will
no longer receive emails about it from us.

<p>
If you wish to remain on the waitlist, you do not need to do
anything. If another seat shows up, an new email outlining this
offer and expiry time will be sent to you.
